When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	When we need to work with multiple persons to complete the task, it would be easy 
	when we use remote repository so what we can invite people to work on the task.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	In case new code available has some bugs & I do not want that to affect my code 
	then I can be done if we have manual pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	Forks, Clones & Branches are various ways to keep the codes cleaner from other drafts.
	Branches are used when we need to try adding new functionalities.
	Fork can be done only to different location where as Clone we can make where ever we have 
	access to.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	In case of long time disconnect between us & remote it would be good to have last known
	state of the remote stored locally so that when we connect back we can synch.
